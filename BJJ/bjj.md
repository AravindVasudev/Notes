### Cross collar choke from closed guard
* Important part of Japanese Jiu Jitsu and Kodokan Judo.
* Helio Gracie got 4/8 submissions using this.

### Scissor sweep
* Helps you go from close guard position to mount and potentially cross choke since your one wrist is alright set up.
* Two variations:
    * If your opponent is off their base, just sweep their legs.
    * If they got a strong base, kick their knee out first, get them off base, and then sweep.
* End the motion with switching to a mount position while keeping your collar grip.
